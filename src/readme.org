** Stories
*** As a user I need to add several coffee items to an order
In order to collect info on what I've sold for analysis
*** As a user I need to use an ergonomic way to add items
In order for it to be fast, so that I can do it in a rush.
( If its slow it may be unusable )
*** As a user I need to remove items from an order
In order to accomodate people who change their mind
*** As a user I need to see the total price and the list of items
In order to confirm my math, and allow non-math people to do the same

In order to review later
